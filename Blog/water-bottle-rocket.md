# I need to build a watterbottle rocket

My Boss said we are going to be making and launching rockets with a group of kids in a week and I said OK.

That day I Googled everything about how rockets work and why they are so complicated. It gave me a sense of new found respect for NASA and rocket engineers in general.

Now, It's time to build and test some rockets and I cant find a 2 liter bottle model online anywhere to use as a reference. This took some time but I found some photos of bottles traced, scaled and importeed them into Fusion360. From, There I revolved the drawing to create a 3d model of a 2 liter mtn dew bottle.
