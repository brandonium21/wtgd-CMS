# IDesign Spray Booth

My local fab lab aquired a few SLA printers and with that brought a wave of D&D miniture prints. These prints require a lot of post processing (painting, priming, curing etc..). My lab manager and I decided to design and build a spray booth. 



### Features:

1. Detachable work area
2. Casters
3. Open base (storage)
4. Filter (nasty fume ejection)
5. Attach to air extraction system



I started by designing the booth in Fusion360 it took about 27 versions but we got there.

My director has access to a big Shopbot CNC so we were able to but out the pieces accurately and with minum effort from 2 sheets of scrap 3/4 in plywood.

After cutting out all the parts Neil assembled it and thats when I got excited.

The furnace filters sit up against this thin cross hashed backer to create a negative pressure chamber that forces over spary and particles through the filter. and out through the air extraction system.

All it took was a couple of screws 2 sheets of 3/4 plywood and 2 2x4x10.
