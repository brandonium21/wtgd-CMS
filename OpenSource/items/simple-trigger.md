I had decided to build a laser tag platform with multiple classes with a co-worker of mine. After, thing about it we decided to start with the fundamental parts and make them modular. The parts included a cpu, trigger, target and barrel. I wanted the parts to be simple and cheap.

I made a simple trigger from a m4 screw, m4 nut, zip tie, and a couple of 3d printed parts.

This design is great for electronic switching applications that require a squeeze trigger. By, adhereing cooper tape to the lip of the trigger housing you can detect a trigger squeeze and implement an action be it analog or controlled by a micro controller. 

The Resistance provided by the zip tie allows for a satisfying trigger pulling experience. The model is also customizable feel free to form the front part of the trigger to anything you want.

The files are hosted on thingiverse feel free to print and try them out.
