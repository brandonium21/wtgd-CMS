#### Microbit 2x40 Right-angle Edge connector pinout

I needed to use the microbits intergrated radio feature to control a big door. I required the use of relays and limit switches so, I needed access to more I/O on the board. However, there were no resources on the interwebs so I ended up buying the [2x40 Right-angle edge connector](https://adafru.it/3342) from Adafruit and mapping them myself. Here are the pictures for ref.
