#### I need a lock box.

Well lets make one! This was the birth of the lock box project. My co worker decided to build an escape room camp for kids. But we needed to teach them about designing and creating puzzles. The lock box was a perfect lesson, it allows flexibility in the code that opens it and requires the children to build it and understand the inner workings.

I mocked it up in a 3D CAD software and the rest is history.
