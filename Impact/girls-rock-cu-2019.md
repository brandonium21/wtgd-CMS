My co-worker Maxx has this friend that volunteers at a camp that teaches girls to have high self esteem and self worth. They do this by providing a platform where the girls write record and preform an original song. They name of the band I had the pleasure of meeting was "The Animal Friends Forever Band". 

Maxx was not avalible for the camp so I decided to give it a shot. I figured since its a band camp and they will preform why not make VIP back stage passes? I designed and fabricated the passes and the girls would paint the back of them and give 2 of them to a couple VIPs in their life. I had a ton of Fun working with them and I believe they had a ton of fun making them. 

## This is what they came up with:
