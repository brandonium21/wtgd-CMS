While working at the Champaign-Urbana Community Fablab I have the oppertunity to work with a lot of children and young adults. When Our director approached me with the task of building and launching rockets with the youth of Champaign-Urbana I was a little less than eagar to partake but I thought this might be FUN.

To my surprise the experience was unforgettable apparently kids just like everyone else love when things fly into the air and come plummeting down to the ground and break neck speeds. After Designing and testing my water bottle rockets we tasked the children with building and designing their own.

We had a rocket that resembled Stan from South Park and even a magma themed rocket. All-in-all this is definitely an undertaking that I'd do again and look forward to do so in the future. Interesting enough we launched our rockets on the aniversary of the Apollo 11 misson.
