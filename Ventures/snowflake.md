There was a time when I was building a [streetwear brand](https://www.whilethegluedries.com/ventures/dontae). While on Instagram which ended up being my most profitable and engaging platform. There was only 1 problem, Instagram only allows one hyper-link. And as an up and coming brand I had a website, Facebook, Tumblr, Twitter etc. but I couldn't get the traffic from instagram to those platforms until I made this web application.

##### A WEB APP TO KEEP A COLLECTION OF ALL YOUR URL’S

SnowFlake is a web app that gives you a unique link for a collection of links that you provide. While Instagram only grants you one URL, Snowflake provides a way to share all your links.

Allows you to input a number of URL’s (e.g. for your own social networking site links, or personal websites).

**Use case:**  When you want to display all your websites, but are only allowed a limited number of hyperlinks, you can use this URL.

I found that my users used it for academic reasons and to share game links. I plan to rebuild the application now that delicious ( rival app ) is no longer avalible.
