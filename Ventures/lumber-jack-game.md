What happens when 3 friends with their bellies full sit in a room? They make the Lumber Jack game. The Lumber Jack Game is a board game in which 3 - 4 players enter a compition to see who can chop down their tree the fastest. One would think that turning trees into logs would be a boring undertaking, Not here! With players able to level up their tools, natural disaters coming out of nowhere and forest critters doing there thing; chopping down trees become real interesting.

#### The objective
Players must chop down their tree first.

#### About the game

All player start off with scissors as their base tool. All tools have a power rating thats denotes how effective they are at making logs.

The power rating coorelates to the hardness of the tree at different sections of the trunk. With every chop the power rating of the tool subtracts from the hardness of the tree trunk. 

ex. (scissors PR = 1 and the hardness at the tippy top of the tree is 1. This means it takes 1 chop to make your first log.)

Now, I know your wondering how do I know when to chop? That depends on how much foliage your able to collect. 

At the beginning of your turn you roll the dice the total shown is the amount of foliage(in-game currency) you collect. 

ex. You roll 5 then you get 5 units worth of foliage.

There are 3 types of foliage:
- Leaf = 1
- Acorn = 3
- Pinecone = 6

In this economy the cost of a chop is the same all the time the only thing that changes is the amount of chops needed and that is affected by the power rating of your tool.

The cost of a chop is 1 pinecone = 6 leaves = 2 acorns.

You may also upgrade your tool to increase productivity but its expensive coming in at a whopping 2 pinecones = 12 leaves = 4 acorns.

As you progress through the tree you will notice that chopping the tree with scissors can be counter productive and very expensive.

We can not forget that we are woring in nature there arenumber of forces that impead us from doing our job we call them **Natural Disaters**. And they come and the most in opertune times. Usually they are invoked fellow lumberjacks to slow you down.

The great news is that every natural disaster can be removed by paying the foliage cost. However, being that they are natural disaters; you cannot continue to chop if you are afflicted by a natural disaster.** You must pay the relief cost and remove the disaster before you can continue making logs**

The squirrel, bees, and ants can be deployed by your oppenents but the storm comes if any one rolls snakes eyes or 12.

To increase Productivity and add a bit of fun the Lumber Jack game employs a chance card mechanic. we have 12 diffrent cards in a 30 card deck. 

Chance cards can be purchased once every turn same as natural disaters and upgrading tools.
