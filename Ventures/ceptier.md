While working at [The Champaign-Urbana community fablab](https://cucfablab.org "The Champaign-Urbana community fablab") as a technology consultant I found that people need an intuitive solution to problems. After helping our clients I realized I have a special skill set that could serve a wide range of problems.

After convincing my self [Ceptier](https://ceptier.com "Ceptier") a venture worth pursing I asked my co-worker to Andrew to help build the company. Andrew has machining and quality assurance experience while I have software and electrical engineering experience. Together, we can make fully functional products that last. 

####Our value proposition: 
We have had time to learn and implement cutting edge technologies. We are able to provide state of the art products for projects that require advanced fabrication and/or innovative software technologies.

With the world moving twords a digital future and companies needing to keep pace, we are in a great position to offer expertise and insight without the over head of hiring a dedicated team. We believe in clear and descriptive documentaion that would allow any team of enginners to revise or maintain our solutions.

#### Focus:

After some research and planning we found that small companies want a product and big companies want a revision. This didn't come as a surpise, after all big companies have data on what they need to satisfy there consumers and internal teams; while startups and small businesses are testing there hypotheses and can be more risky. Ceptier would aim for the middle small business with more 20+ employees and in the growth stage that way we lower the amount of revisions needed because theres more data present and we constrain our selves furthe to achieve our goal.
