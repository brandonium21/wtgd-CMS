So early one day decided to slack off and play video games. Usually, this would be an easy task grab a controller and proceed to the nearest console. Unfourtunately, I was at work and had no access to a console. Now, This would have discouraged a novice slacker but not me! I remembered the Retro Pie console i had in my drawer, the problem was that i still don't have a controller to play with. 

By now I have realized that this won't be a slack worthy day but instead a day of maker proportions. The Makey Makey is a capacive touch platform where people can turn anything that can handle a current into a touch sensitive trigger that maps to strokes on a keyboard. This means you can play musical chairs with actual chairs.

The problem is that the base Makey Makey has only 2 action buttons and thats not enough to play any respectable game. I was looking mash buttons like the world's about to end. So, I needed to make use of the breakout pins on the back.

Using these pins I was able to add start, select, A, B, X, Y, L-shoulder, and R-shoulder buttons to my controller. I decider to laser cut the chasse and buttons then add copper tape to make action regions on my controller.

I used Fusion360 to design it and add pressfit spacers to allow for wire routing and space for the Makey Makey to fit in the box.

The controller ended up working pretty well I added peice of funky foam in the middle of the D-pad to mimic the rocking motion. And to keep you grounded I added a strip of copper tape to the back to that you're allways grounded.

The electronics was fairly simple just connect the header pin to the appropriate copper tape. After this was all finished I used [Makey Makeys remap](https://makeymakey.com/pages/remap "Makey Makeys remap") tool to map the pins to the appropriate keyboard strokes.

### Conclusion:

My slack off day did not happen but after making the controller i decide to personalize it by adding a decal and blogging about it. So far I've played SNES Sonic and super mario and a random rpg on a flash game site. If you like this let me know by subscribing to my newsletter.
