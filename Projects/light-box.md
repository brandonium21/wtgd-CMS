Now I know maybe you have seen this before. But I made mine for a different reason. I wanted to display 8 bit sprites on my desk while I worked. And I succeeded. I completely modeled this light box in Fusion360 then converted the the pieces into drawings and proceeded to cut them out on the laser cutter. This was a very rewarding project and I want to build one every year until i have a huge wall.

 After designing the box and laser-ing everything out. Assembly was simple. The hard part was extending the neopixels because they did not center with in the lased boxes.
