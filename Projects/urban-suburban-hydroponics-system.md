Hey there I currently live in Champaign-Urbana, and they are big on agriculture here. I have always wanted a garden I can tend to and harvest when the time comes but unfortunately I live in an apartment. Yup I'm a millennial in college no money and no assets and yet I want to farm. So I decided to try, and here's what I came up with.

##### PROBLEMS
 1. No space
 2. Ugly carpet
 3. Low window count
 4. Rent to high
 5. Yard is a poop mine feild
 6. I have to pay for laundry
 7. Bus never ontime
 8. Sleep is a luxury not a necessity
	etc...

#### SOLUTION! BUILD A GARDEN IN A WINDOW!
I decided to build the garden in a window because I literally have no space and actual sunlight ha limited range in my space. After putting it together it worked until I added the wrong amount of nutrients but anyway let me show you how it all worked out.

##### MATERIALS
 - 1/4 in birch plywood
 - 8 x 1 in plywood
 - Glue
 - PVC pipe and couplers ( depends on your setup )
 - 1 x Sump pump
 - 1/4 in Vinyl tubing
 - 90 degree angle brackets

##### TOOLS
 - 3D printer
 - Hack saw
 - Lasercutter
 
#### PROCESS/EXPLAINATION
Hydroponics: [hahy-druh-pon-iks] noun  the process of growing plants in sand, gravel, or liquid, with added nutrients but without soil.

###### The Reservoir:

Water enters the reservoir which is 2x the size of the Sub Grow beds reason for this is pressure equalizer. It acts as a water tower keeping the grow beds at the right level so not to flood plants the coupler/reducers block the water from going back and ensures the water stays in the pipe. evaporation is the only thing you need to worry about.

###### Sub Grow bed:

Hold plants and outputs water to next Sub Grow bed or bucket.

The build and fabrication process is very straight forward. So, here are pictures.

My favorite part is the K-cup holders I 3D printed the lip on top holds a small K-cup snugly and and grips the pipe without slipping.

#### FULL ASSEMBLY

Well that's it took about 8 hours to build and it was very gratifying to see the plants grow until I added to much miracle grow. I was in the midst of adding automatic PH balances and sensors to make this an IOT project but when the plants died I got discouraged so I didn't, maybe it should have inspired me.
