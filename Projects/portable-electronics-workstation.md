I was In college once as a Electrical Engineering major. I mostly taught my self about electronics but I had a mentor when learning software development. The difference is the type of tools needed, I needed soldering irons, wire cutters, wire strippers, component storage, breadboards testing equipment, power supply etc.

I tried fitting all of this into my college dorm room. And I succeeded for a while. Until I had to do another subject. My desk had become a mess and it took nearly an hour to re organize and hide everything. It was a bad situation.

I decided to research portable electronic workstations. But they do not exist and the ones people made were super huge. I resolved to build my own and this what I came up with.

This is one of my biggest projects to date. And its due for a redesign.

#### The Overhead Light
So this is easily one of my favorite features I literally thought I was a genius. In the top left corner of the box was a light. There is a magnet on the top and cardboard for flexibility holding the light arm to the box. Swing it up the magnet holds it. Turn it on done!

#### THE POWER SUPPLY:

I took a 24v 6A power brick apart and used a buck converter and ATmega to regulate and display voltage, The output went to screw post of my breadboard. 12v 5v variable.

#### THE STORAGE:

I was very proud of this. I stayed with in the dimensions of a standard briefcase. That meant I only had an inch to store all my components. So i designed and 3d printed 1 inch capsules to store resistors, LEDs, transistors etc. and it worked! I then took some chipboard and looped it and stapled it to hold all of my capsules.

#### THE BUILT IN ARDUINO

I drilled a hole into the side of the box to expose an Arduino USB I then broke out the pins through a slot and inserted them into the breadboard. This was great because Arduinos slide everywhere and break my jumpers.

#### THE POWER STRIP

I mounted a power strip to the side, You would not think you would need one but I did so it became a feature. I can not tell you how often it came in handy. Computer phone, soldering iron, etc.

#### THE SOLDER STATION.

I mounted helping hand in the bottom right of the box for holding perfboards. There was also a small computer fan with a carbon filter under it. For soldering in my dorm room, This box is just packed with features. Also there was a slot on top to hold a soldering iron holder.

#### Conclusion

All-in-all the portable electronic workstation was a success but it proved to be bulky and had more features than I needed. Many of my friends believe that I should sell them but before that happens I need to revisit it's usecase. Now, that there is a push to put electronics education in schools I find myself wanting to redesign my workstation to make it well suited for classroom use.
